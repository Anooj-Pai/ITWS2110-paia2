            <p>Our little furry friend Daffodil just found his forever home! Thank you so much to the volunteers 
              over at H.O.H Sanctuary for saving this baby and taking such good care of him. We are so proud
              that Hop could play a part in finding Daffodil his forever home. If you have a chance, please check out our
              bunnies near by page to look at all the local rabbits in shelters that need homes!</p>

            <h2>Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease</h2>
            <h5>Health and Safety, Sep 2, 2022</h5>
            <img src="img/blog2.jpg" alt="protect your bunny" id="image2">
            <p>RHDV2 is highly contagious and, unlike other rabbit hemorrhagic disease viruses, it
              affects both domestic and wild rabbits. Many times, the only signs of the disease are
              sudden death and blood stained noses caused by internal bleeding. Infected rabbits may
              also develop a fever, be hesitant to eat, or show respiratory or nervous signs.
              In February 2020, RHDV2 was detected in a domestic rabbit
              in New York City. The virus was quickly identified, isolated
              and eradicated. There does not appear to be an epidemiological
              link, but the disease was later confirmed in a rabbit in New
              Mexico in March 2020. Since then, RHDV2 has continued to
              spread in New Mexico and across multiple states, including
              Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, Texas, and New York. Please take precautions
              and vaccinate your bunnies today!</p>
