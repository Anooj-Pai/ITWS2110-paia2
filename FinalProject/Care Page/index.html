                      <p class="title">85% of diet</p>
                      <p>Grass and hay should make up the majority of your rabbits diet. It is not only
                        important for their gastrointestional health, but also their dental health. When rabbits
                        chew on the coarse fibers of hay, the chewing motion ensures that their teeth, which 
                        continously grow throughout their lives, stay at a healthy length. Hay of higher
                        nutritional quality are the best choice for rabbits due to their high energy requirement. 
                        They should have access to an unlimited amount of fresh hay at all times, it is very important
                        that rabbits continue to graze to keep their gi track moving.

                      <p class="title">10% of diet</p>
                      <p>Vegetables are an excellent source of nutrients for your pet rabbit. There is a vast list of acceptable 
                        veggies that rabbits can safely consume. Due to the delicate balance required inside a rabbits gut, we recommend 
                        choosing two or three of the leafy varieties that your rabbit enjoys. It is best to stick with those unless your
                        rabbit decides they do not fancy it anymore. Rabbits do not require the same variation in their diet that humans do. 
                        Too many diet changes can be incredibly detrimental to the health of your rabbit.</p>

                          <p class="title">5% of diet</p>
                          <p>Although pellets are market heavily as being the biggest source of food for a rabbit, there are a lot
                            of studies that show a diet consiting of too many pellets does more harm than good. Most of a rabbits 
                            nutrition and minerals come from eating hay, which is simply just dried grass, and fresh veggies. Pellets
                            were only created to fatten up caged rabbits that were bred for food. To avoid rabbit obesity, pellets should
                            be given in limited quanity. Always double check that there are no added sugars or extra fiber in the pellets, 
                            because those can cause problems for rabbits as well.
