For this lab I wanted to make the website as visually appealing as posible. Unfortunately I am the farthest thing from
creative or good at design. This meant a bootstrap template would be the perfect option for me. I used a template called 
Grayscale (linked below), and added, changed, and rearanged the elements to make it work best for the site. Using the template made all the boiler plate code much easier to start and finish, along with the design of the site. 

The next biggest task I took on was the form. The template did not have one so I had to use the different CSS classes to make the form look in place. This was difficult at first because of the slew of classes that were there but I think I did a good job making it fit in. Along side the design of the form, the functionality was the next issue. I ended up using an API called SMTPJS which facilitated the email sending aspect of the form. I found it through a tutorial I saw (which are both linked) and that helped a ton.

One small thing that I want to point out is when you submit the form an error comes up. This is not an issue with the code but just the authorization of the email client because I did not want to put my password on here. 

Other than that everything went smoothly and I actually like how the site looks and functions very much.
