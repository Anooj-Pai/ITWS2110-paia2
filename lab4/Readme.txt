For this lab I wanted to use open weather map and another api in conjunction. I wasn't sure on what I wanted to make but then,
I thought of movies. What if there was a way to suggest movies based off the weather? I found the TMDB API online and decided
that would be the perfect api to use for this. What my program does is, it gets the weather for whatever city you want and depending
on the conditions it sugests movies based on a genere search. 

At first I was a little lost but the tutorials I linked below allong with the documentation for the movie api I was able to create my site.
There dont seem to be any issues now but one big one I faced was moving the data for the weather from one script to the other. I found that session
storage was the best becuase it acted like cookies for the website. Once I got that working I just switched the api call for all the conditions and it was done!
