For this quiz I wanted to use the same style of presenting my data as I did in Lab 4.
For this reason I used the code from my lab for the HTML and CSS. I also used some of my JS from the last lab,
but I changed a lot so it was more just getting me started. As it was said in the doc we could not just use buttons
to show and hide the data so I used a mixture of buttons and hovers to display it. The code was similar but the function is very
different. I really like how it came out and I think it looks very clean. I also added some tags under the currency to let the user
know what they should do to access the data. Linked below I have the page I used to get the show and hide working and also just
that I used my lab 4 code as well. For the hover I just changed the attribute on the tag but didnt have to change anything on the 
JS end of things.

One thing I wanted to do better was have less functions in my script. I wasn't sure how to do this in the time given
but if I was able to go back I would see how to make it all work in 1 function for the show and 1 for the hover.
